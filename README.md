=========

Pathfinder-Editor is a WebApp (hosted) that will help players and game masters using the [Pathfinder Role Playing System by Paizo](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG).
It will, at least, contain every entry from the [PRD](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/), with an editor to enable adding new content.
